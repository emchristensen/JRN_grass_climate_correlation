  This data package contains soil water content data calculated from
  monthly neutron hydroprobe count measurements made at 15 net primary
  production (NPP) study locations on Jornada Experimental Range (JER)
  and Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) lands. Once a
  month, neutron probe measurements are made at 10 depths (where
  possible) at each of 10 access tubes at each of the 15 NPP sites using
  a neutron probe (CPN Model 503DR Hydroprobe). The raw dataset, also on
  EDI (knb-lter-jrn.210013001), consists of the count of thermalized
  neutrons at 30 cm depth intervals to a maximum depth of 300 cm. In
  this data package, the raw neutron counts have been adjusted for
  radioactive decay of the neutron source, then converted to volumetric
  water content (VWC) to a maximum depth of 270 cm using calibration
  equations (deepest probe depths are excluded from VWC calculations).
  The NPP sites these measurements are made at represent the 5 dominant
  vegetation types of the Jornada Basin, which consist of 3 shrub
  (creosotebush, mesquite dune, and tarbush) and 2 grass (upland
  grassland and playa) types. Three NPP sites are located in each of the
  types. This data collection is ongoing with new data collected monthly
  (updates to the EDI package may occur less frequently).

      
        NOTE: The next update to this data package will be delayed
  until calibration equations can be developed for a new hydroprobe unit
  that has recently been put into service. Repair parts were no longer
  available for the older unit.

        NPP (and soil water) is measured at 15 sites, spanning 5 vegetation community types in the Jornada Basin. This bounding box includes all 15 sites. More precise geographic coordinates for this study may be requested from the JRN LTER Data Manager.

  Monthly soil water content measurements measurements are made at 10
  depths (where possible) at each of 10 probe access tubes at each of
  the 15 plant NPP sites. The 10 probe access tubes at each site are
  paired on each of the four sides and in the middle of the 70m x 70m
  area used for long term plant NPP measurements. At the time of access
  tube installation (aluminum 2 inch diameter irrigation pipe), the
  pairing consisted of an access tube inserted vertically into the
  ground midway under a shrub canopy of the dominant species and one
  between shrubs. For grass dominated habitats, an access tube was
  installed in the middle of the dominant perennial grass with the
  second in the bare area between grass patches. Changes in perennial
  plant cover through mortality or establishment may have changed this
  relationship for some access tubes over the years.

          
  Measurements with the neutron hydroprobe are taken at 30cm, 60cm,
  90cm, 120cm, 150cm, 180cm, 210cm, 240cm, 270cm, and 300cm when
  possible or to the greatest depth to which the associated access tube
  could be installed before hitting an impenetrable petrocalcic layer
  (caliche). Periodic "case standard" measurements are also
  taken with the probe for each measurement campaign. The hydroprobe
  detector totals the returning thermalized neutrons over a 16 second
  sample time. This raw count value is then substituted into the proper
  regression equation to calculate cubic centimeters of water per cubic
  centimeter of soil (volumetric water content - VWC). Values of VWC for
  the deepest available depth at each access tube are not calculated
  because the soil volume directly below the probe is greater, and
  therefore biased, relative to shallower depths.

          
  Initial calibration regression equations were derived for the LTER-I
  Transect soil water content study and applied to the measurements at
  the NPP sites. Between 2003 and 2007 individual site regressions were
  developed by Mike Duniway to better represent the variation in
  soil characteristics. All data since initiation of the study (1989)
  have now been recalculated using the new equations. The raw counts
  of thermalized neutrons have also been adjusted to account for drift
  associated with the decay rate of the Americium 241/Beryllium used to
  generated the neutrons.

          
  This data package provides the adjusted neutron counts, calculated
  VWC, and ancillary calibration information (the attached
  "Duniway_and_Crossland_2016_NeutronMoisture_Meter_Calibration.pdf").
  The raw neutron count hydroprobe data, field methods, and measurement
  history are provided in a separate Jornada Basin LTER data package on
  EDI (knb-lter-jrn.210013001).
