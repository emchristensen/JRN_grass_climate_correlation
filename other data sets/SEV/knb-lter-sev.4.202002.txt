  In 1989, line-intercept transects were installed to evaluate temporal
  and spatial dynamics across vegetation transition zones.  Currently, a
  400m transect is sampled at a grassland site (Deep Well) which is
  dominated by Bouteloua eriopoda (black grama) and, near the southern
  end of the transect, B. gracilis (blue grama).  A second grassland
  site (Five Points), dominated by B. eriopoda and, to the south, Larrea
  tridentata (creosote), is also sampled.  Both sites are sampled twice
  a year, in May/June and September/October, and measurements are taken
  at a one-centimeter resolution.  The biannual sampling protocol
  detects potential responses in both cool and warm season plants as
  well as pre- and post-monsoon dynamics.  Several transects have been
  discontinued and data archived within SEV200.

  2009 Wildfire On Aug 4, 2009, a lightning strike ignited a fire in the
  area west of the road from Black Butte to Five-Points. The fire
  started around 3:30 PM on the 4th. The fire was initially concentrated
  in the Grassland Drought, SMES, and Monsoon study areas. The next day,
  the fire carried north and east to the Deep Well Meteorological
  station, Warming, Deep Well Line Intercept transect, and Nut-Net plot
  areas. The fire was finally contained by the end of the 5th covering
  ~7800 ha. Other researchers involved with collecting samples/data:

  Maintenance:

      
  8/12/2010-The data in this file has been QA/QC'd and imported into
  MySQL. Unknown forbs were identified as UNKNO for the species code.
  (ALS) 12/08/2009-The data in this file has been QAQC'd in My SQL and
  on-line as well. Due to wildfire at Sevilleta LTER on Aug 5 2009, some
  plants were not identified. New variables were added, such as BGRASS
  (burned grass), BVEG (burned vegetation),  BSHRUB (burned shrub), and
  BFORB(burned forb). 12/20/2008-The data has been QAQC'd in My SQL. All
  plant codes have been updated to current Kartesz codes as listed in
  the USDA Plants Database found at http://plants.usda.gov/.
  Questionable identifications and mistakes were updated to the best of
  my (data manager's) ability. Old codes are maintained in the database
  and can be obtained by contacting the data manager. (KRW) Changes to
  the data: This dataset (SEV004) includes all active line intercept
  data from Transect 1 at both Deep Well and Five Points.  Old species
  codes are maintained in the database and can be obtained by contacting
  the data manager. Old data and metadata can be found in:
  /export/db/local/htdocs/data/archive/plant/transect/data_oldformat but
  this data has NOT been vigorously QAQC'd and contains errors.
  2/25/2020-Species typos corrected and outdated synonyms updated. One
  instance of a stop &lt;0 and one &gt;400 have been corrected. The
  dataset still contains start/stop errors which will be corrected in
  the future.

        Five Points is the area which encompasses the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote Core study sites and falls along the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats. Both sites are subject to intensive research activity, including NPP measurement, phenology observation, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments. There are drought rain-out shelters in both the Black Grama and Creosote sites, as well as the mixed-ecotone, with co-located ET Towers.

  Preparing Transects for Measurement: A 100m measuring tape is unrolled
  and affixed to permanent pieces of rebar hammered into the ground at
  each of the four segments of a 400 m transect. For example, a tape is
  attached to the 0 meter (north) rebar stake and run to the 100 meter
  (south) stake. The tape is stretched as tightly as possible to get the
  straightest line. Windy days should be avoided as the wind moves the
  tape and results in inaccurate data. Recording data: Crew members work
  in groups of two, with one crew member making observations and the
  other recording them in an Excel spreadsheet on a Samsung smartphone.
  Each species or substrate (i.e., bare soil, litter) that intersects
  the tape and occupies at least one centimeter is recorded whether
  rooted beneath the tape or not. Observations are recorded at the cm
  level, the point at which the species or substrate first crosses the
  tape being stated. This starting location is noted but the ending
  point is considered to be the starting point of the next species or
  substrate, unless otherwise stated (as in the case of overlapping
  plants). For example, Bouteloua eriopoda encountered at 12m 79cm,
  litter encountered at 12m 82 cm, bare soil at 12m 85 cm, and so forth.
